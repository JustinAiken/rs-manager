    > what s/w would you recommend for this 
    
    - [BiasFX](https://www.positivegrid.com/bias-fx/) (often has a free version with a couple of amps)
    - [Amplitube](https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/amplitubecs/)
    - [Revalver](https://revalver.peavey.com/)

    Or you could use a DAW to reroute it through something like an AxeFX, Line6 gear, or even physical tube amps.. 
    

- ##### Notes about BETA
   
    The hit and perfect percent tracking capabilities are in beta. If things are working correctly, the Note Stats 
    field should say `Active`. If they are showing wrong/no values you can try the following (in order):
      
     - Stop and Start tracking again.
     - in Rocksmith, go back to main menu and start the song again.
     - if all else fails, Restart Rocksmith, Stop and Start Tracking again.
