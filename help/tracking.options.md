- ##### Notes about BETA
   
    The hit and perfect percent tracking capabilities are in beta. If things are working correctly, the Note Stats 
    field should say `Active`. If they are showing wrong/no values you can try the following (in order):
      
     - Stop and Start tracking again.
     - in Rocksmith, go back to main menu and start the song again.
     - if all else fails, Restart Rocksmith, Stop and Start Tracking again.
