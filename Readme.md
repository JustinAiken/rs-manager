# Rocksmith Manager
Rocksmith's UI leaves a lot to be desired especially when you have a lot of songs in your collection.  Rocksmith Manager uses Rocksmith + Steam data to consolidate stats/mastery/dlc/setlists under one roof. 

Current Functionalities:
    
    * Dashboard View - 
    * Songs->Owned View -
    * Songs->Available View -
    * Setlist->Favorites View -
    * Setlist->PracticeList View -
    * PSARC Explorer -
    * Song Detail View

TODO:
    
    * import all setlists from game
    * generate youtube playlist of current view
